# Using Digest field in Signatures

This is the working area for the individual Internet-Draft, "Using Digest in Signatures".

* [Editor's Copy](https://ioggstream.github.io/draft-polli-digest-signatures/#go.draft-polli-digest-signatures.html)
* [Individual Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-polli-digest-signatures)
* [Compare Editor's Copy to Individual Draft](https://ioggstream.github.io/draft-polli-digest-signatures/#go.draft-polli-digest-signatures.diff)

This I-D provides guidance in using Digest field 
with signature mechanisms like [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) or [Message Signatures](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/blob/master/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures.md).
